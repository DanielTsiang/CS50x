# Implementation Details

Implement, in a file called cash.c in a ~/pset1/cash directory, a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.


Your program should behave per the examples below.
 ```
$ ./cash
Change owed: 0.41
4
```

```
$ ./cash
Change owed: -0.41
Change owed: foo
Change owed: 0.41
4
```
